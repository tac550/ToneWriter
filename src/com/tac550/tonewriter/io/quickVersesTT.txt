# Lamp-Lighting Psalms

Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks to Thy name!
The righteous will surround me; for Thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
Out of the depths I cry to Thee, O Lord. Lord, hear my voice!
Let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications!
If Thou, O Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand? But there is forgiveness with Thee.
For Thy name's sake I have waited for Thee, O Lord, my soul has waited for Thy word; my soul has hoped on the Lord.
From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch let Israel hope on the Lord.
For with the Lord there is mercy and with Him is plenteous redemption, and He will deliver Israel from all his iniquities.
Praise the Lord, all nations! Praise Him, all peoples!
For His mercy is abundant towards us; and the truth of the Lord endures forever.

# Aposticha

# Sunday
The Lord is King; He is robed in majesty!
For He has established the world, so that it shall never be moved.
Holiness befits Thy house, O Lord, forevermore!

# Weekday
To Thee, O Lord, I lift up my eyes, O Thou who art enthroned in the heavens. As the eyes of a servant look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the Lord our God, till He have mercy on us.
Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us, for we have had more than enough of contempt. Too long our soul has been sated with the scorn of those who are at ease, the contempt of the proud.

# Rememberance
Blessed are those whom Thou hast chosen and taken, O Lord.
Their souls shall dwell with the blessed.

# The Praises

...to execute on them the judgment written. This is glory for all His faithful ones.
Praise God in His sanctuary; praise him in His mighty firmament!
Praise Him for His mighty deeds; praise Him according to His exceeding greatness!
Praise Him with trumpet sound; praise Him with lute and harp!
Praise Him with timbrel and dance; praise Him with strings and pipe!
Praise Him with sounding cymbals; praise Him with loud clashing cymbals! Let everything that breathes praise the Lord!
